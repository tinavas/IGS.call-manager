  or no answer, or with the information requested. <br>
  <br>
  [03] For your protection and quality assurance, the remainder of this call
  will be recorded. Do I have your permission to do this? <br>
  <br>
  [04] Today's date is: Jul 24, 2012, and the current time is 10:26AM eastern
  standard time. <br>
  <br>
  [05] The recording of this call will verify your information as a matter of
  record, and, once completed, your confirmation and acceptance of IGS Energy's
  offer will be your agreement to initiate service with us and begin
  enrollment. Was this your understanding? <br>
  <br>
  [05d] Are you over 18 and the customer of record or authorized to make
  changes on this account? <br>
  <br>
  [05g] Is this account for your home or business?<br>
  <br>
  [06] Please state your name: [_________] <br>
  [09] Please state your phone number: [________]<br>
  [10] Please state your email address: [__________]<br>
  <br>
  [13] I show the name that appears on the bill as __________. Is that correct?
  <br>
  <br>
  [14] I have your account number as __________. Is that correct?  <br>
  <br>

  customer, please state the billing address.<br>
  <br>
  [17.1] You want to enroll with IGS Energy for electricity service at the new
  electric standard power price of 8 point 89 cents per kWh over the next 12
  months. With your secondary term, you will continue with IGS Energy on a
  month-to-month basis at a monthly variable price. Is this correct?<br>
  <br>
  [21.5] And for enrollment and service purposes, you authorize IGS Energy, who
  is an approved supplier and not an affiliate of PECO, to obtain account
  number and usage information on your account. Do you understand?<br>
  [22.6] Now remember, with this program, PECO will still read your meter and
  provide your emergency customer service just like they always have. You also
  understand you will continue to receive one bill every month from PECO. It
  will include the cost of the electricity from IGS Energy and PECO’s delivery
  charges. Do you understand?<br>
  <br>
  [26.10] And do you understand that IGS Energy is not an affiliate of PECO,
  but is an approved supplier in their Supplier Choice Program?<br>

  service. You have ten business days from the confirmation notice postmark
  date to rescind your enrollment. If you want to rescind, you should call PECO
  at 1-800-494-4000. Do you understand?<br>
  <br>
  [28.12] Within 3 business days, IGS Energy will send to you a Welcome Letter,
  along with the full terms and conditions that were summarized in this call.
  Please review the welcome letter and terms and conditions, and if you have
  any questions, or if for any reason you do not receive the terms and
  conditions, please contact IGS Energy at 1-800-280-4474 or PO BOX 9060,
  Dublin, Ohio 43017. <br>

  your rates will then appear on your bill in 1-2 billing cycles.<br>
  <br>
  [30.14] And as your last confirmation on this call, do you agree to enroll
  with IGS Energy in the Supplier Choice Program?<br>
  <br>
  [31.15] Ok, your verification is now complete; let me give you your
  confirmation number... </span></p>
