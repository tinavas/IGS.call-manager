<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>01] Hello, this is
_________with IGS Energy verifying your enrollment with IGS Energy as your
natural gas supplier in DTE - Michcon's Gas Customer Choice Program<br>
<br>
[02] Please respond to the following questions with a clear yes or no answer,
or with the information requested. <br>
<br>
[03] This call is required to be recorded; is that okay with you? (MUST GET A
CLEAR &quot;YES&quot;, “NO” or “OKAY” RESPONSE TO ALL QUESTIONS)<br>
<br>
[04] If you do not understand or are unclear about anything I say, please stop
me and I will repeat the question.<br>
<br>
[05] Today's date is ________ and the time is ______PM eastern standard time. <br>
<br>
[05b] First, did the agent provide to you a Notice of Cancellation, as well as
the Contract Signature Page with terms and conditions on the back?<br>
<br>
[05c] Please have the Contract document ready, as I will refer to it during the
verification.<br>
<br>
[05e] And did the sales agent state that he or she is representing IGS Energy,
an Alternative Gas Supplier, and is not from DTE - Michcon, your utility
company?<br>
<br>
[05h] Are you current on paying your DTE - Michcon gas bill?<br>
<br>
[06] Now, we need to verify your information directly from your utility bill:<br>
<br>
[07] Please state your name: [______________] <br>
<br>
[08] Please state the name on the account: <br>
<br>
[09] Please state your mailing address. ______________________________. <br>
<br>
[10] Please state your service address. ______________________________.<br>
<br>
[11] Please state your telephone number. [______________] <br>
<br>
[12] Do you have an e-mail address that you would like to add to your account?<br>
<br>
[13] Please state your account number. ________________<br>
<br>
[14] Has all of this information been entered onto the Contract?<br>
<br>
[15] You want to enroll with IGS Energy as your natural gas supplier at a fixed
price of 49 point 9 cents per CCF through your June 2013 billing cycle; this
price excludes all applicable state and local taxes and DTE - Michcon service
and delivery charges. OKAY?<br>
<br>
[16] Has the price of 49 dollars and 9 cents per CCF been inserted into the
‘Sales Price’ section of the Contract and have you initialed it?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[18] Has the term of your FIXED price period been inserted into the ‘Sales
Price’ section of the Contract and have you initialed it?<br>
<br>
[19] If you are not completely satisfied with IGS Energy's service or price,
you may cancel this agreement at any time without penalty.<br>
<br>
[20] IGS Energy will send this request to DTE - Michcon within 1 business day
and your rate will then appear on your DTE - Michcon bill in 1-2 billing
cycles.<br>
<br>
[21] DTE - Michcon will still be your natural gas utility company. DTE -
Michcon will receive your natural gas from IGS Energy and deliver it to you,
send your bill like they always have, and if you ever have a natural gas emergency,
you would still call DTE - Michcon. OKAY?<br>
<br>
[22] This agreement is only for DTE - Michcon customers that consume less than
5,000 CCF of natural gas per year. If you are a commercial customer and use
more than that limit, IGS Energy may void or terminate your enrollment and
transfer your service to DTE - Michcon without penalty. OKAY?<br>
<br>
[23] IGS Energy will be sending a confirmation letter. You have 30 days from
today to rescind your enrollment, which will cancel your Contract. If you want
to rescind, you should call IGS Energy at 1-800-280-4474.<br>
<br>
<br>
[25] Within seven calendar days, IGS Energy will send to you a welcome letter,
along with a courtesy copy of the full terms and conditions that you have
discussed with the sales agent today. Please review the welcome letter and if
you have any questions, or if for any reason you do not receive the letter,
please contact IGS Energy at 1-800-280-4474 or PO BOX 9060, Dublin, Ohio 43017.<br>
<br>
[26] Should you decide to change your mind for any reason and wish to rescind through
IGS Energy, you will have three business days from today’s date to contact IGS
Energy and they will rescind the enrollment.<br>
<br>
[27] Your verification is now complete. I have a confirmation number, which
I’ll ask you to write down and give to the Sales Agent.</span></p>
