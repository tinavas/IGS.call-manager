          verifying your enrollment with IGS Energy as your natural gas
          supplier in Consumers Energy's Gas Choice Program.<br>
          <br>
          [02] Please respond to the following questions with a clear yes or no
          answer, or with the information requested. <br>
          <br>
          [03] This call is required to be recorded; is that okay with you?
          (MUST GET A CLEAR &quot;YES&quot;, “NO” or “OKAY” RESPONSE TO ALL
          QUESTIONS)<br>
          <br>
          [04] If you do not understand or are unclear about anything I say,
          please stop me and I will repeat the question.<br>
          <br>
          [05] Today's date is _____ and the time is _____ eastern standard
          time. <br>
          <br>
          [05b] First, did the agent provide to you a Notice of Cancellation,
          as well as the Contract Signature Page with terms and conditions on
          the back?<br>
          <br>
          [05d] Please have the Contract document ready, as I will refer to it
          during the verification.<br>
          <br>
          [05e] And did the sales agent state that he or she is representing
          IGS Energy, an Alternative Gas Supplier, and is not from Consumers,
          your utility company?<br>
          <br>
          [05f] Are you over 18 and the customer of record or legally authorized
          to make changes on this account?<br>
          <br>
          [05h] Are you current on paying your Consumers gas bill?<br>
          <br>
          [06] Now, we need to verify your information directly from your
          utility bill:<br>
          <br>
          [07] Please state your name: <br>
          <br>
          [08] Please state the name on the account: <br>
          <br>
          [09] Please state your mailing address.  <br>
          <br>
          [10] Please state your service address.  <br>
          <br>
          [11] Please state your telephone number. [] <br>
          <br>
          [12] Do you have an e-mail address that you would like to add to your
          account?<br>
          <br>
          [13] Please state your natural gas POD (point of delivery) number. <br>
          <br>
          [14] Has all of this information been entered onto the Contract?<br>
          <br>
          [15] You want to enroll with IGS Energy as your natural gas supplier
          at a fixed price of 4 dollars and 99 cents per MCF through your June
          2013 billing cycle; this price excludes all applicable state and
          local taxes and Consumers Energy service and delivery charges. OKAY?<br>
          <br>
          [16] Has the price of 4 dollars and 99 cents per MCF been inserted
          into the ‘Sales Price’ section of the Contract and have you initialed
          it?<br>
          <br>
          [18] Has the term of your fixed price period been inserted into the
          ‘Sales Price’ section of the Contract and have you initialed it?<br>
          <br>
          [19.3] If you are not completely satisfied with IGS Energy's service
          or price, you may cancel this agreement at any time without penalty.<br>
          <br>
          [20.4] IGS Energy will send this request to Consumers within 1
          business day and your rate will then appear on your Consumers bill in
          1-2 billing cycles.<br>
          <br>
          [21.5] Consumers will still be your natural gas utility company.
          Consumers will receive your natural gas from IGS Energy and deliver
          it to you, send your bill like they always have, and if you ever have
          a natural gas emergency, you would still call Consumers. OKAY?<br>
          <br>
          [22.6] You understand that IGS Energy is not the utility company, but
          an approved natural gas supplier participating in the Consumers
          Energy Gas Choice Program. Correct?<br>
          <br>
          [23.7] This agreement is only for Consumers customers that consume
          less than 500 MCF of natural gas per year. If you are a commercial
          customer and use more than that limit, IGS Energy may void or
          terminate your enrollment and transfer your service to Consumers
          without penalty. OKAY?<br>
          <br>
          [24.8] IGS Energy will be sending a confirmation letter. You have 30
          days from today to rescind your enrollment, which will cancel your
          Contract. If you want to rescind, you should call IGS Energy at
          1-800-280-4474.<br>
          <br>
          [26] Within seven calendar days, IGS Energy will send to you a
          welcome letter, along with a courtesy copy of the full terms and
          conditions that you have discussed wit<a name="_GoBack"></a>h the
          sales agent today. Please review the welcome letter and if you have
          any questions, or if for any reason you do not receive the letter,
          please contact IGS Energy at 1-800-280-4474 or PO BOX 9060, Dublin,
          Ohio 43017.<br>
          <br>
          [27] Should you decide to change your mind for any reason and wish to
          rescind through IGS Energy, you will have three business days from
          today’s date to contact IGS Energy and they will rescind the
          enrollment.<br>
          <br>
          [28] Your verification is now complete. I have a confirmation number,
          which I’ll ask you to write down and give to the Sales Agent.</span></p>
