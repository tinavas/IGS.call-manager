Was this your understanding? <br>
<br>

[05c] First, did the agent provide to you a Notice of Cancellation, as well as
the Acknowledgement Form?<br>
<br>
[05d] Are you over 18 and the customer of record or authorized to make changes
on this account? <br>
<br>
[05d1] <br>
<br>
[05e] And did the sales agent state that he or she is representing IGS Energy
and is not from Vectren or Dayton Power and Light?<br>
<br>
[05f] Are you more than 60 days past due on paying your Vectren gas bill? Or are
you currently enrolled in the Percentage of Income Payment Plan, also known as
PIPP, for your gas account?<br>
<br>
[05g] Is this account for your home or business?<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
[07] Please state the name on the account:<br>

<br>
[11] <br>
[12] <br>
<br>
[13] I show the name that appears on the bill as _____________. Is that
correct? <br>
<br>
[14] I have your electricity service delivery identification number as ___________,

<br>
[17.1] You want to enroll with IGS Energy as your natural gas supplier at the
fixed price of 54 point 9 cents per CCF through the June 2013 billing cycle.
This price excludes all applicable state and local taxes and Vectren service
and delivery charges. You also wish to enroll with IGS Energy as your
electricity supplier at the fixed price of 6 point 49 cents per kWh over the
next 12 months. Is this correct? <br>
<br>
[18.2] <br>
[19.3] <br>
[20.4] <br>
<br>
[21.5] And for enrollment and service purposes, you authorize IGS Energy, who
is an approved supplier and not an affiliate of Vectren or an affiliate of
Dayton Power and Light, to obtain account number and usage information on your
account. Do you understand?<br>
<br>
[22.6] Now remember, with these programs, Vectren and Dayton Power and Light
will still read your meter and provide your emergency customer service just
like they always have. You also understand you will continue to receive one
bill every month from Vectren, and one from Dayton Power and Light. They will
include the cost of the electricity and natural gas from IGS Energy and Vectren
and Dayton Power and Light service and delivery charges. Do you understand?<br>
<br>
[23.7] <br>
[24.8] <br>
[25.9] <br>
<br>
[26.10] And do you understand that IGS Energy is not an affiliate of Vectren or
an affiliate of Dayton Power and Light, but is an approved supplier in their
Supplier Choice Program?<br>
<br>
[27.11] <br>
<br>
[27.12] This agreement is only for Vectren customers that consume less than 50,000
CCF of natural gas per year. If you are a commercial customer and use more than
that limit, IGS Energy may void or terminate your enrollment and transfer your
service to Vectren without penalty. OKAY? <br>
<br>
[27.13] Vectren and Dayton Power and Light will both be sending a confirmation
notice of the transfer of service. You have seven calendar days from DP&amp;L’s
confirmation notice postmark date and seven business days from the Vectren
confirmation notice postmark date to rescind your enrollment. If you want to
rescind, you should call Vectren at 1-800-227-1376 or Dayton Power and Light at
1-800-929-8646.</span></p>
