your enrollment with IGS Energy as your natural gas supplier in Columbia Gas of
Pennsylvania gas choice program.<br>
<br>
[02] Please respond to the following questions with a clear yes or no answer,
or with the information requested. <br>
<br>
[03] This call is required to be recorded; is that okay with you? (MUST GET A
CLEAR &quot;YES&quot;, “NO” or “OKAY” RESPONSE TO ALL QUESTIONS)<br>
<br>
[04] If you do not understand or are unclear about anything I say, please stop
me and I will repeat the question.<br>
<br>
[05] Today's date is ________ and the time is ____PM eastern standard time. <br>
<br>
[05b] First, did the agent provide to you a Notice of Cancellation, as well as
the Acknowledgement Form?<br>
<br>
<br>
[05e] And did the sales agent state that he or she is representing IGS Energy
and is not from Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania?<br>
<br>
[05h] Are you more than 60 days past due on paying your Columbia Gas of
Pennsylvania gas bill? Or are you currently enrolled in the Customer Assistance
Program, also known as CAP? <br>
<br>
[06] Now, we need to verify your information directly from your utility bill:<br>
<br>
[07] The name on the bill is [_____________] <br>
<br>
[08] Is your name [_____________]?<br>
<br>
[09] Please state your mailing address__________________________<br>
<br>
<br>
[11] Is your service address the same as your mailing address?<br>

<br>
[13] Do you have an e-mail address that you would like to add to your account?<br>

<br>
[15] You want to enroll with IGS Energy as your natural gas supplier at a
stable price of 47 point 5 cents per THERM through your June 2013 billing
cycle; this price excludes all applicable state and local taxes and Columbia
Gas of Pennsylvania service and delivery charges. OKAY?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[17] IGS Energy will send this request to Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania within 1
business day and your rate will then appear on your Columbia Gas of
Pennsylvania natural gas bill in 1-2 billing cycles.<br>
<br>
[18] Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania will still be your natural gas utility
company. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania will receive your natural gas from IGS
Energy and deliver it to you, send your bill like they always have, and if you
ever have a natural gas emergency, you would still call Columbia Gas of
Pennsylvania. OKAY?<br>
<br>
[20.4] This agreement is only for Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania customers that
consume less than 20,000 THERM of natural gas per year. If you are a commercial
customer and use more than that limit, IGS Energy may void or terminate your
enrollment and transfer your services to Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania without
penalty. OKAY?<br>
<br>
[21.5] Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania will be sending a confirmation notice of
the transfer of service. You have ten business days from the confirmation
notice postmark date to rescind your enrollment. If you want to rescind, you
should call Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania at 1-888-460-4332.<br>

along with a courtesy copy of the full terms and conditions that you have
discussed with the sales agent today. Please review the welcome letter and if
you have any questions, or if for any reason you do not receive the letter,
please contact IGS Energy at 1(800)280-4474 or PO BOX 9060, Dublin, Ohio 43017.<br>
<br>
[24.8] Should you decide to change your mind for any reason and wish to rescind
through IGS Energy, you will have three business days from today’s date to
contact IGS Energy and they will rescind the enrollment.<br>
<br>
[25.9] Your verification is now complete. I have a confirmation number, which
I’ll ask you to write down and give to the Sales Agent.<span style='color:#666666'>
