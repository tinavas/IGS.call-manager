[02] Please respond to the following questions with a clear yes or no answer,
or with the information requested. <br>
<br>
[03] For your protection and quality assurance, the remainder of this call will
be recorded. Do I have your permission to do this? <br>
<br>
[04] Today's date is: Jul 17, 2012, and the current time is 4:16PM eastern
standard time. <br>
<br>
[05] The recording of this call will verify your information as a matter of
record, and, once completed, your confirmation and acceptance of IGS Energy's
offer will be your agreement to initiate service with us and begin enrollment.
Was this your understanding? <br>
<br>
[05b] If you do not understand or are unclear about anything I say, please stop
me and I will repeat the question.<br>
<br>
[05c] Have you received the Disclosure Statement and Notice of Cancellation?<br>
<br>
[05d] Are you over 18 and the customer of record or authorized to make changes
on this account? <br>
<br>

<br>
[05h] And do you heat with natural gas or electricity?<br>
<br>
[06] Please state your name: [customer name] <br>
<br>
[07] Please state the name on the account: [name on bill]<br>
<br>
[09] Please state your phone number: [phone number]<br>
<br>
[10] Please state your email address: [email - optional]<br>
<br>
[13] I show the name that appears on the bill as [name on bill]. Is that
correct? <br>
<br>
[14] I have your account number as [account number]. Is that correct? <br>
<br>
[15] I have your service address as: [service address]. Is that correct? <br>
<br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:115%'>[16] And
your billing address is the same. Is that correct? If not, then customer,
please state the billing address. (<i>Alternative if customer has billing
address:</i> And your billing address is [billing address]. Is that correct?)<br>
<br>
[17.1] And you want to enroll with IGS Energy for electricity service at the
new electric standard power price of [electricity price] over the next 12
months. With your secondary term, you will continue with IGS Energy on a month-to-month
basis at a monthly variable price. Is this correct?<br>
<br>
[21.5] And for enrollment and service purposes, you authorize IGS Energy, who
is an approved supplier and not an affiliate of ComEd, to obtain account number
and usage information on your account. Do you understand?<br>
<br>
[22.6] Now remember, with this program, ComEd will still read your meter and
provide your emergency customer service just like they always have. You also
understand you will continue to receive one bill every month from ComEd. It will
include the cost of the electricity from IGS Energy and ComEd’s delivery
charges. Do you understand?<br>
<br>
[26.10] And do you understand that IGS Energy is not an affiliate of ComEd, but
is an approved supplier in their Supplier Choice Program?<br>
<br>
[28.12] IGS Energy will send to you a Welcome Letter, along with a courtesy
copy of the full terms and conditions. You may rescind this agreement within 10
business days after ComEd processes your enrollment by calling 1-800-280-4474.
Even if you cancel after these 10 business days of enrollment, you will not be
charged any cancellation fees. Do you understand?<br>
<br>
[28.13] Should you decide to change your mind for any reason and wish to
rescind through IGS Energy, you will have three business days from today’s date
to contact IGS Energy and they will rescind the enrollment.<br>
<br>
[29.13] IGS Energy will send this request to ComEd within 1 business day and
your rates will then appear on your bill in 1-2 billing cycles.<br>
<br>
[30.14] And as your last confirmation on this call, do you agree to enroll with
IGS Energy in the Supplier Choice Program?<br>
<br>
[31.15] Ok, your verification is now complete, can you please hand the phone to
the agent so that I can give them a confirmation number for your enrollment
with IGS Energy.</span></p>
