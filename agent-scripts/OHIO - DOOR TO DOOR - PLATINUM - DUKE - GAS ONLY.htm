<br>
[04] Today's date is: __________, and the current time is ____PM eastern
standard time. <br>
<br>
[05] The recording of this call will verify your information as a matter of
record, and, once completed, your confirmation and acceptance of IGS Energy's
offer will be your agreement to initiate service with us and begin enrollment.
Was this your understanding? <br>
<br>
[05b] If you do not understand or are unclear about anything I say, please stop
me and I will repeat the question.<br>
<br>
[05c] First, did the agent provide to you a Notice of Cancellation, as well as
the Acknowledgement Form?<br>
<br>
[05d] Are you over 18 and the customer of record or authorized to make changes
on this account? <br>
<br>

bill?, or are you currently enrolled in the Percentage of Income Payment Plan,
also known as PIPP?<br>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[11]
I show the account type as residential. Is that correct?<br>
<br>
[13] I show the name that appears on the bill as ___________. Is that correct? <br>
<br>
[14] I have your account number as ___________. Is that correct? <br>
<br>
<br>
[15] I have your service address as: ___________________. Is that correct? <br>
<br>
[16] And your billing address is the same. Is that correct? If not, then
customer, please state the billing address.<br>
<br>
[17.1] You want to enroll with IGS Energy for natural gas service at the new
price of 49 point 9 cents per CCF over the next 9 months. With your secondary
term, you will continue with IGS Energy on a month-to-month basis at a monthly
variable price. Is this correct?<br>
<br>
[21.5] And for enrollment and service purposes, you authorize IGS Energy, who
is an approved supplier and not an affiliate of Duke Energy, to obtain account
number and usage information on your account. Do you understand?<br>
<br>
[22.6] Now remember, with this program, Duke Energy will still read your meter
and provide your emergency customer service just like they always have. You
also understand you will continue to receive one bill every month from Duke
Energy. It will include the cost of the natural gas from IGS Energy and Duke
Energy’s delivery charges. Do you understand?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[26.10] And do you understand that IGS Energy is not an affiliate of Duke
Energy, but is an approved supplier in their Supplier Choice Program?<br>
<br>
[27.11] Duke will be sending a confirmation notice of the transfer of service.
You have seven business days from the confirmation notice postmark date to
rescind your enrollment. If you want to rescind, you should call Duke at
1-800-544-6900.<br>
<br>
[27.12] This agreement is only for Duke Energy customers that consume less than
50,000 CCF of natural gas per year. If you are a commercial customer and use
more than that limit, IGS Energy may void or terminate your enrollment and
transfer your service to Duke Energy without penalty. OKAY? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[28.12] IGS Energy will send to you a welcome letter, along with the full terms
and conditions that were summarized in this call. Please review the welcome
letter and terms and conditions, and if you have any questions, or if for any
reason you do not receive the terms and conditions, please contact IGS Energy

<br>
[28.13] Should you decide to change your mind for any reason and wish to
rescind through IGS Energy, you will have three business days from today’s date
to contact IGS Energy and they will rescind the enrollment.<br>
<br>
[29.13] IGS Energy will send this request to Duke Energy within 1 business day
and your rates will then appear on your bill in 1-2 billing cycles.<br>
<br>
[30.14] And as your last confirmation on this call, do you agree to enroll with
IGS Energy in the Supplier Choice Program?<br>
<br>
[31.15] Ok, your verification is now complete, can you please hand the phone to
the agent so that I can give them a confirmation number for your enrollment
with IGS Energy.</span></p>
