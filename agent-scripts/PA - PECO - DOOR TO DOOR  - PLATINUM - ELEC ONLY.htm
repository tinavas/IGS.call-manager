<br>
<br>
[05d] Are you over 18 and the customer of record or authorized to make changes

<br>
[17.1] You want to enroll with IGS Energy for electricity service at the new
electric standard power price of 9 point 29 cents per kWh over the next 12
months. With your secondary term, you will continue with IGS Energy on a
month-to-month basis at a monthly variable price. Is this correct?<br>
<br>
[21.5] And for enrollment and service purposes, you authorize IGS Energy, who
is an approved supplier and not an affiliate of PECO, to obtain account number
and usage information on your account. Do you understand?<br>
<br>
[22.6] Now remember, with this program, PECO will still read your meter and
provide your emergency customer service just like they always have. You also
understand you will continue to receive one bill every month from PECO. It will
include the cost of the electricity from IGS Energy and PECO’s delivery
charges. Do you understand?<br>
<br>
[26.10] And do you understand that IGS Energy is not an affiliate of PECO, but
is an approved supplier in their Supplier Choice Program?<br>
<br>
[27.11] PECO will be sending a confirmation notice of the transfer of service.
You have ten business days from the confirmation notice postmark date to
rescind your enrollment. If you want to rescind, you should call PECO at
1-800-494-4000. Do you understand?<br>
<br>
<br>
[28.12] Within 3 business days, IGS Energy will send to you a Welcome Letter,
along with the full terms and conditions that were summarized in this call.
Please review the welcome letter and terms and conditions, and if you have any
questions, or if for any reason you do not receive the terms and conditions,
please contact IGS Energy at 1-800-280-4474 or PO BOX 9060, Dublin, Ohio 43017.
<br>
<br>
[28.13] Should you decide to change your mind for any reason and wish to
rescind through IGS Energy, you will have three business days from today’s date
to contact IGS Energy and they will rescind the enrollment.<br>
<br>
[29.13] IGS Energy will send this request to PECO within 1 business day and
your rates will then appear on your bill in 1-2 billing cycles.<br>
<br>
[30.14] And as your last confirmation on this call, do you agree to enroll with
IGS Energy in the Supplier Choice Program?<br>
<br>
[31.15] Your verification is now complete. I have a confirmation number, which
I’ll ask you to write down and give to the Sales Agent.</span></p>
